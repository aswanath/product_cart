# product_cart

## It is a simple app with products fetched from an API and we can change the item quantity and it will be reflected across the pages.

### ❤️ It uses BLoC state management to persist the state.

## Getting Started

### For get_it and injectable, run command:

```
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
